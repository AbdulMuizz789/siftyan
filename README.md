# Siftyan

## 📌 Project Overview
**Siftyan** is a local **CLI (Command-Line Interface)** tool written in **Go** that scans a project's dependencies to detect **software license conflicts**.

It analyzes dependencies from package managers such as:

- Python (`pip`)
- Node.js (`npm`)

Siftyan identifies license types used by each dependency and detects **incompatible license combinations**. It explains conflicts in **simple English**, shows the **cause of the conflict**, and suggests **possible solutions**.

The tool outputs:

- A **terminal summary**
- A **detailed HTML report**
- An **interactive dependency graph**

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Modern software projects rely heavily on third-party libraries. These libraries come with different **software licenses** (MIT, GPL, Apache, BSD, etc.).

Some licenses have restrictions that may **conflict with other licenses or the project's license**, which can cause legal or distribution issues.

Developers often detect these conflicts **very late in development**.

**Siftyan solves this problem** by automatically scanning dependencies and clearly explaining conflicts.
